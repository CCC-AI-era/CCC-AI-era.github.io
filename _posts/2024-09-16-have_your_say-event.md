On 13th September 2024, we held the event titled "Have your say! — Coding Education 
and AI". 

For this event, we gathered HE educators around 
Glasgow to talk about the current coding education and impact of AI in coding 
education. 
In this project, we aim to examine and improve coding education in this AI-era. 
This event served as a community building activity as well as to gain insight 
into the current situation surrounding this topic. 

We had a very good turnout, which lead to a very lively and active discussion 
throughout the event. Through this, we gained many insights around the challenges
that we face today as well as potential ideas around how we could tackle them.
