This is the main website for the **Coding, Creativity, and Confidence in AI-Era** project.

This project is funded by the University of Glasgow's Glasgow Crucible Seed-Fund 2024. 

We seek to understand and improve coding education in a range of disciplines in this AI-Era where a flood of AI-based tools are being introduced to the society and thus our learning environments.
